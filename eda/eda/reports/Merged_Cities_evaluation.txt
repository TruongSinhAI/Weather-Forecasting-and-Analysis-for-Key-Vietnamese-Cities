Suggested Preprocessing Steps based on Evaluation:
  - Metric 'temp' is skewed. Consider applying transformations like log or box-cox to reduce skewness.
  - Metric 'precip' is skewed. Consider applying transformations like log or box-cox to reduce skewness.
  - Metric 'windspeed' is skewed. Consider applying transformations like log or box-cox to reduce skewness.
